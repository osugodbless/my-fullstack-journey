2. [Linux Shell Basics](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php) – Learning to move around directories in the Linux file system.  
3. [Looking Around](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0030.php) – Exploring the content of directories or files with commands like `ls` `less` and `file`.  
4. [Manipulating Files](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0050.php) – Commands for creating, copying, moving, and deleting files.
