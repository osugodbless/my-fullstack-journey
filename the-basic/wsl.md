I have a machine with Windows Operating System installed but what I needed was a Linux environment for actual practice. This made me dive into virtualization and learn about virtual machines. I later found out about the option of using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Docker but decided to settle for WSL because it was the best option for a beginner like me who wanted to use Linux without letting go Windows.
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without needing a separate virtual machine. Below is the link to a Microsoft resource that guided me through the installation process of WSL.
