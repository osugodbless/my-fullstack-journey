Well, I already learnt about git sometime ago when I took an introductory course on HTML and CSS. However, below are some resources I used as a refresher and, they are enough to help anyone build a solid foundation in Source Control Management with Git.
1. [Start your Source Control Management (SCM) journey](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey) – Introduction to Git and version control.
2. [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) – How to write effective README files.  
3. [How to write Git commit messages well](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) – Best practices for crafting meaningful Git commit messages.  
4. [Learn Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) – An interactive tool for understanding Git branching.
5. [Pull Requests](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/) – Good practices for creating and managing pull requests in GitHub
