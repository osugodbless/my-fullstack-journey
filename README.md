# **My Fullstack Journey**
The purpose of this repository is to act as a documentation of my journey into fullstack development. This repository is divided into three (3) main sections:

* [the-basic](the-basic/): This directory contains a documentation of my learning journey through basic concepts like how the internet works, navigating Linux, text editor (vi) and others

* [120-days-of-frontend](120-days-of-frontend/)
: A dedicated folder for my frontend development practices, projects, and learning resources. This section covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frontend frameworks and libraries.

* [120-days-of-backend](120-days-of-backend/)
: This section is focused on backend development, where Iâ€™ll work on server-side programming, databases, APIs, and backend frameworks.

You can explore each section, simply by navigating to the corresponding folder. Each day, I'll add code, notes, and insights as I progress, documenting both the successes and challenges along the way.

**Enjoy!**
