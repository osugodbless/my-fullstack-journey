# **My Fullstack Journey**
The purpose of this repository is to act as a documentation of my journey into full-stack development. This repository is divided into three (3) main sections:

* [the-basic](the-basic/): This directory is dedicated to foundational knowledge that sets the stage for everything else in development. However, this repository only contains a curated collection of resources that helped me grasp the fundamental concepts and tools required to begin my journey as a developer, unlike the backend and frontend which captures my daily activities over 120 days.

* [120-days-of-frontend](120-days-of-frontend/): This is a dedicated directory for my frontend development practices, projects, and learning resources. This section covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frontend concepts, frameworks and libraries.

* [120-days-of-backend](120-days-of-backend/): This directory is focused on backend development, where Iâ€™ll work on server-side programming, databases, APIs, and backend frameworks.

You can explore each section, simply by navigating to the corresponding folder. Each day, I'll add code, notes, and insights as I progress, documenting both the successes and challenges along the way.

**Cheers to Fullstack!**
