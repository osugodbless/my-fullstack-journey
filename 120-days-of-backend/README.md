# 120 Days of Backend Development

Welcome to the **Backend Development** section!  
This directory contains my learning journey into the server-side of web development over 120 days. Here, I’ll tackle the technical challenges of building robust and efficient backend systems.

## What You'll Find Here:
- Server-Side Programming: Node.js, Python, or other backend languages
- Database Management: SQL, NoSQL, and Query Optimization
- Building and Consuming RESTful APIs
- Authentication and Authorization Techniques
- Performance Optimization and Security Best Practices

## Goal:
My objective is to gain technical expertise in backend development by understanding how to build scalable and secure server-side applications.

## Structure:
Each subdirectory or file corresponds to a specific day or topic with associated tasks or projects, making it easy to follow my progress. I’ll document both successes and challenges to provide a realistic picture of the learning process.

Cheers to backend!
