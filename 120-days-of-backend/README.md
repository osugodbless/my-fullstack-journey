# 120 Days of Backend Development

Welcome to the **Backend Development** section!  
This directory contains my learning journey into the server-side of web development over 120 days. Here, Iâ€™ll tackle the technical challenges of building robust and efficient backend systems.

## Highlights:
- Server-Side Programming: Node.js, Python, or other backend languages
- Database Management: SQL, NoSQL, and Query Optimization
- Building and Consuming RESTful APIs
- Authentication and Authorization Techniques
- Performance Optimization and Security Best Practices

## Objective:
My objective is to gain technical expertise in backend development by understanding how to build scalable and secure server-side applications.

## Progress Tracker:
Each subdirectory or file corresponds to a specific day, task, or project, allowing for an organized and detailed documentation of my progress.

Cheers to backend!
